# Typescript Code Challenge

Thanks for applying for a frontend developer role at Outdoorsy. We've put together this code challenge. It should take around two hours to complete.

## App functionality
This task is to develop a single-page app that provides the ability to search Outdoorsy listings by keyword. Users will be able to type keywords in a text field. Typing in the text field will search for relevant results and display them for the user. Listings should display an image of the vehicle and the vehicle's name.
### What the app should look like
See https://github.com/outdoorsy/interview-challenge-frontend/blob/master/Challenge-Design.png
### The API you will need to use
See https://github.com/outdoorsy/interview-challenge-frontend/blob/master/API.md

## Quality requirements
- Build this as if it will be maintained for a while (code organization, maintanability, extensibility).
- **Ensure strong type coverage with TypeScript**.
- Refine types that are unknown to the client.
- Performant API requests
## What we’re looking for
- Functionality of project matches description above
- Visual design (mostly, not pixel perfect) matches designs
- Ability to think through all potential states
- Code design/style should be consistent and reasonable
- In the `README.md` of the project, describe exactly how to run the application
## Notes
- Please make frequent and descriptive git commits.
- Use any dependencies that you find useful to complete the task.
- Please use **Next.js/React and Typescript**.

When complete, please push your code to Github and send the link to the project or zip the project (including the `.git` directory) and send it back.

**Thank you and please ask if you have any questions!**
